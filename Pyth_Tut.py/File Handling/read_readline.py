# The readline() method reads a single line from the File
# if you want to read the multiple lines you can use the loops
# f = open("myfile.txt",'a')
# # while True:
# #     line = f.readline()
# #     if not line:
# #         break
# #     print(line)
# i = 0
# while True:
#     i = i +1

#     line = f.readline()
#     if not line:
#         break

#     m1 = line.split(",")[0]
#     m2 = line.split(",")[1]
#     m3 = line.split(",")[2]
#     print(f"Marks of student {i} in Maths is: {m1}")
#     print(f"Marks of student {i} in English is: {m2}")

# The writelines method in Python is used to write a list of strings to a file. It allows you to 
# write multiple lines to a file in one operation, rather than writing them one by one.

# lines = ['line 1\n','line 2\n','lines3\n']
# f.writelines(lines)
# f.close()

# a = [5,1,2,4]
# b = a.append(1)
# print(b)
