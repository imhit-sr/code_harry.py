# Recursion in Python is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem.
# Key Points
# Recursion: The function calls itself with a smaller problem.
# Base Case: Essential to prevent infinite recursion.
# Recursive Case: Breaks the problem into smaller instances, working towards the base case.




# def factorial(num): 
#     if (num == 1 or num == 0):
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return (num * factorial(num - 1)) 
  
# # Driver Code 
# num = 7; 
# print("Number: ",num)
# print("Factorial: ",factorial(num))
