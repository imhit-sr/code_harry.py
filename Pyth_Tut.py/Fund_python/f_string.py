# f-strings are prefixed with an f or F and contain expressions inside curly braces 
# {} that are evaluated at runtime and inserted into the string.
# print(f"{2 * 30}")

# # String formatting in python
# txt = "For only {price} dollars!"
# print(txt.format(price = 49))
# a = "rajesh"
# print(f"How are you {a}")

# In Short:
# {} acts like a placeholder.
# Whatever is inside {} is evaluated (like variables, expressions, or function calls).
# The result replaces {} in the final string when the code runs.
