#>>>>> Day  58(Constructors in python)<<<<<
# A constructor is a special method in a class 
# There are different types of constructors. Constructor is 
# invoked automatically when an object of a class is created.
# There are two types of constructors:(parameterized and default)
# When the constructor accepts arguments along with self, it is known as parameterized constructor.
# class Person:
  

#   def __init__(self, name, occ):
#     print("Hey I am a person")
#     self.name = name
#     self.occ = occ

#   def info(self):
#     print(f"{self.name} is a {self.occ}")


#   def fur_info(self,father_occupation):
#      return  f"{self.name} is a {self.occ} and father is {father_occupation}"


# a = Person("Harry", "Developer")
# a.info()
# print(a.fur_info("Farmer"))
